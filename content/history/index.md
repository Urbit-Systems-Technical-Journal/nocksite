# History of Nock

Nock is a combinator calculus designed by Curtis Yarvin from 2002 onwards and elaborated subsequently by other contributors.  While it has undergone several revisions, all have in common 

1. Pragmatic minimalism:  as simple as viable, and no simpler.
2. Functional purity:  no undefined behavior, no side effects except via explicit runtime hints.
3. Homoiconicity:  code and data share the same representation.
4. Virtualizability:  the ability to extend the base language via first-class virtualization.
5. Namespace extension:  the ability to step beyond apparent scope restrictions using referential transparency.

Namespace extension also implies hyper-Turing completeness:  a system architected on Nock can build a virtualization function that has the ability to answer, in certain cases, whether or not the computation will halt.
