# Relationship to Hoon

TODO: Add content for Relationship to Hoon

This section is under development.

To quote the [Hoon docs](https://docs.urbit.org/hoon/why-hoon):

> Subject orientation in Nock ... stems partly from minimalism: there's just one subject, which serves as state, lexical scope, environment, and function argument; partly from a desire to simplify compilation: the type of the subject is a full specification of the compile-time environment for a source file; and partly to give the language a more imperative feel.
