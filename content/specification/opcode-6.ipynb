    "# Opcode 6: Conditional\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```nock\n",
    "*[a 6 b c d]       *[a *[[c d] 0 *[[2 3] 0 *[a 4 4 b]]]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Opcode 6 implements a conditional branch.  Evaluate test formula b; if true (0), evaluate and return c; if false (1), evaluate and return d. Crashes on non-boolean test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate `b` against the subject, which must produce 0 or 1.\n",
    "2. If 0 (true): evaluate `c` against subject and return.\n",
    "3. If 1 (false): evaluate `d` against subject and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any other value crashes (as enforced by the macro expansion).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, much of the weirdness of the macro expression can be explained by its parsimonious use of the boolean result.  From right to left:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `*[a 4 4 b]` evaluates b, then adds 2 (so 0 → 2, 1 → 3).\n",
    "2. `*[[2 3] 0 ...]` uses the result as an address into `[2 3]`.\n",
    "3. `*[[c d] 0 ...]` uses 2 or 3 as address into `[c d]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleverly selects `c` (at address 2) for true, `d` (at address 3) for false.  (It does not pass through directly to avoid other results selecting other possible slots.)"
