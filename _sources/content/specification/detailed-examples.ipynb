    "\n",
    "- Boolean logic (`AND`, `XOR`, `NOT`, etc.) must be implemented out of Nock primitives rather than being axiomatically supplied as operators.\n",
    "- Side effects (like printing) will be handled by raising special noun patterns to the Nock evaluator.\n",
    "- Memory is entirely handled by the Nock evaluator.\n",
    "- Type systems are not part of Nock itself, but can be layered on top of it.\n",
    "- Evaluation rules are defined, but their implementation is omitted.  You can use a tree-walking interpreter, a bytecode interpreter, or something even more clever to run Nock in practice.  (In fact, you can treat Nock as a spec and not run it at all, as long as you get the same answer!)"
