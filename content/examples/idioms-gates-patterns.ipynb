    "When one has spent enough time working with Nock, patterns emerge.  While it's unrealistic to simply sit and read a Nock program at a glance, it is very possible to recognize macroscopic structures that recur.\n",

    "## Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Opcode 9 is built to recall a stored procedure, modify it in a characteristic way, and then invoke it.  This pattern, called a \"gate\", occurs frequently in Nock programs as the most convenient way to implement a function or a subroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the gate is intended to be reused, it is stored with an opcode 1 so it can be retrieved and manipulated as a constant noun prior to execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, this Nock program makes a gate that returns its argument incremented by 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[8 [1 0] [1 4 0 6] 0 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to invoke it with an opcode 9 looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[7\n",
    "   [8 [1 0] [1 4 0 6] 0 1]\n",
    "   [8 [0 1]\n",
    "      [9 2\n",
    "         10 [6 7 [0 3] 1 5] 0 2]]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The meat of the pattern lies in the opcode 9 expression, which we may gloss as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve the gate \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand it using the rules for opcodes 7, 8, and 9 (using `0` as an unused placeholder subject):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "*[a 7 b c]          *[*[a b] c]\n",
    "*[a 8 b c]          *[[*[a b] a] c]\n",

    "\n",
    "## Cores\n",
    "\n",
    "A gate is a specific instance of a more general pattern called a \"core\".  The purpose of a core is to collect a battery of code (even one gate) intended for reuse.  Compare this code, which features two opcode 8 pins, to the prior increment gate:\n",

    "Its standard invocation uses opcode 9 twice:  once to retrieve the core, and once to invoke the target gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can in fact distinguish two ways of storing data in a core:  as code, using opcode 8 pins, and as data, using opcode 1 pins.  This one, for instance, stores the number 42 as raw data inside the core:\n",
