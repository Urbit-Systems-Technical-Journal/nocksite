    "# Opcode 3: Cell Check\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Opcode 3 implements the idiomatic `?` wut cell check operator, which tests whether a noun is a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "```nock\n",
    "*[a 3 b]            ?*[a b]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Opcode 3 tests whether the product of formula b is a cell or an atom.  It returns 0 (yes) if it's a cell, 1 (no) if it's an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate `b` against the subject to produce a noun.\n",
    "2. Test if that noun is a cell.\n",
    "3. Return 0 if cell, 1 if atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "One implication of nouns is that an easy way to tell data apart is by their structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "?[a b]              0\n",
    "?a                  1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`?` wut is useful to ask whether a given noun is a cell or an atom.  (Like C's `int main()` return type and error codes, `0` means `TRUE` and `1` means `FALSE`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "([Opcode 5](opcode-5.ipynb) is closely related, as it tests whether one noun is equal to another.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Opcode 3 is used for type discrimination (by structure before pattern matching) and for validating noun data shapes."
