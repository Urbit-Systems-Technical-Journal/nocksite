# U:  A Small Model

```
U: Definition 
 
1 Purpose 
    This document defines the U function and its data 
    model. 
 
2 License 
    U is in the public domain. 
 
3 Status 
    This text is a DRAFT (version 0.15). 
 
4 Data 
    A value in U is called a "term."  There are three 
    kinds of term: "number," "pair," and "foo." 
 
    A number is any natural number (ie, nonnegative 
    integer). 
 
    A pair is an ordered pair of any two terms. 
 
    There is only one foo. 
 
5 Syntax 
    U is a computational model, not a programming 
    language. 
 
    But a trivial ASCII syntax for terms is useful. 
 
5.1 Trivial syntax: briefly 
    Numbers are in decimal.  Pairs are in parentheses 
    that nest to the right.  Foo is "~". 
 
    Whitespace is space or newline.  Line comments 
    use "#". 
 
5.2 Trivial syntax: exactly 
    term    : number 
            | 40 ?white pair ?white 41 
            | foo 
 
    number  : 48 
            | [49-57] *[48-57] 
 
    pair    : term white term 
            | term white pair 
 
    foo     : 126 
 
    white   : *(32 | 10 | (35 *[32-126] 10)) 
 
6 Semantics 
    U is a pure function from term to term. 
 
    This document completely defines U.  There is no 
    compatible way to extend or revise U. 
 
6.1 Rules 
    [name]   [pattern]                [definition] 
 
    (a)      ($a 0 $b)                $b 
    (b)      ($a 1 $b $c)             1 
    (c)      ($a 1 $b)                0 
    (d)      ($a 2 0 $b $c)           $b 
    (e)      ($a 2 %n $b $c)          $c 
    (f)      ($a 3 $b $c)             =($b $c) 
    (g)      ($a 4 %n)                +%n 
 
    (h)      ($a 5 (~ ~ $b) $c)       $b 
    (i)      ($a 5 (~ $b $c) $d)      *($a $b $c $d) 
    (j)      ($a 5 (~ ~) $b)          ~ 
    (k)      ($a 5 (~ $b) $c)         *($a $b $c) 
    (l)      ($a 5 ($b $c) $d) 
                            (*($a $b $d) *($a $c $d)) 
    (m)      ($a 5 $b $c)             $b 
 
    (n)      ($a 6 $b $c)   *($a *($a 5 $b $c)) 
    (o)      ($a 7 $b)                *($a 5 $a $a $b) 
    (p)      ($a 8 $b $c $d)          >($b $c $d) 
 
    (q)      ($a $b $c)     *($a 5 *($a 7 $b) $c) 
    (r)      ($a $b)                  *($a $b) 
    (s)      $a                       *$a 
 
    The rule notation is a pseudocode, only used in 
    this file. Its definition follows. 
 
6.2 Rule pseudocode: briefly 
    Each line is a pattern match.  "%" means 
    "number."  Match in order.  See operators below. 
 
6.3 Rule pseudocode: exactly 
    Both pattern and definition use the same 
    evaluation language, an extension of the trivial 
    syntax. 
 
    An evaluation is a tree in which each node is a 
    term, a term-valued variable, or a unary 
    operation. 
 
    Variables are symbols marked with a constraint. 
    A variable "$name" matches any term.  "%name" 
    matches any number. 
 
    There are four unary prefix operators, each of 
    which is a pure function from term to term: "=", 
    "+", "*", and ">". Their semantics follow. 
 
6.4 Evaluation semantics 
    For any term $term, to compute U($term): 
 
        - find the first pattern, in order, that 
          matches $term. 
        - substitute its variable matches into its 
          definition. 
        - compute the substituted definition. 
 
    Iff this sequence of steps terminates, U($term) 
    "completes." Otherwise it "chokes." 
 
    Evaluation is strict: incorrect completion is a 
    bug.  Choking is U's only error or exception 
    mechanism. 
 
6.5 Simple operators: equal, increment, evaluate 
    =($a $b) is 0 if $a and $b are equal; 1 if they 
    are not. 
 
    +%n is %n plus 1. 
 
    *$a is U($a). 
 
6.6 The follow operator 
    >($a $b $c) is always 0.  But it does not always 
    complete. 
 
    We say "$c follows $b in $a" iff, for every $term: 
 
        if *($a 5 $b $term) chokes: 
            *($a 5 $c $term) chokes. 
 
        if *($a 5 $b $term) completes: 
            either: 
                *($a 5 $c $term) completes, and 
                *($a 5 $c $term) equals 
                  *($a 5 $b $term) 
            or: 
                *($a 5 $c $term) chokes. 
 
    If $c follows $b in $a, >($a $b $c) is 0. 
 
    If this statement cannot be shown (ie, if there 
    exists any $term that falsifies it, generates an 
    infinitely recursive series of follow tests, or is 
    inversely self-dependent, ie, exhibits Russell's 
    paradox), >($a $b $c) chokes. 
 
7 Implementation issues 
    This section is not normative. 
 
7.1 The follow operator 
    Of course, no algorithm can completely implement 
    the follow operator.  So no program can completely 
    implement U. 
 
    But this does not stop us from stating the 
    correctness of a partial implementation - for 
    example, one that assumes a hardcoded set of 
    follow cases, and fails when it would otherwise 
    have to compute a follow case outside this set. 
 
    U calls this a "trust failure."  One way to 
    standardize trust failures would be to standardize 
    a fixed set of follow cases as part of the 
    definition of U.  However, this is equivalent to standardizing a fixed trusted code base.  The 
    problems with this approach are well-known. 
 
    A better design for U implementations is to 
    depend on a voluntary, unstandardized failure 
    mechanism.  Because all computers have bounded 
    memory, and it is impractical to standardize a 
    fixed memory size and allocation strategy, every 
    real computing environment has such a mechanism. 
 
    For example, packet loss in an unreliable packet 
    protocol, such as UDP, is a voluntary failure 
    mechanism. 
 
    If the packet transfer function of a stateful UDP 
    server is defined in terms of U, failure to 
    compute means dropping a packet.  If the server 
    has no other I/O, its semantics are completely 
    defined by its initial state and packet function. 
 
7.2 Other unstandardized implementation details 
    A practical implementation of U will detect and 
    log common cases of choking.  It will also need a 
    timeout or some other unspecified mechanism to 
    abort undetected infinite loops. 
 
    (Although trust failure, allocation failure or 
    timeout, and choke detection all depend on what 
    is presumably a single voluntary failure 
    mechanism, they are orthogonal and should not be 
    confused.) 
 
    Also, because U is so abstract, differences in 
    implementation strategy can result in performance 
    disparities which are almost arbitrarily extreme. 
    The difficulty of standardizing performance is 
    well-known. 
 
    No magic bullet can stop these unstandardized 
    issues from becoming practical causes of lock-in 
    and incompatibility. Systems which depend on U 
    must manage them at every layer.
