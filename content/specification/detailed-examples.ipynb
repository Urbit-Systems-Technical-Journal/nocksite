    "The high-level idea is that if you only have the ability to increment and check for equality, then you can build a decrement operator by counting up from zero and checking whether adding one to the current number equals the source number.  If it does, then the current number is one less than the source number, thus its decrement.\n",

We can do this by recursively calling our decrement operator with the same `a` and the incremented `b`.  How do we invoke our own operator recursively?  We use an opcode 9 with an opcode 10 to alter the subject for the recursive call.\n",
